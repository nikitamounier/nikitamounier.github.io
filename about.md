Hello there! First of all, thank you for visiting my site. A couple things about me:

- I’m a 16 year old French/American/Russian student at the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle in London
- I’ve been coding Swift in my spare time for the better part of three years, and have definitely fallen in love with it
- I’m invested not only in my projects but also in Swift itself, and regularly contribute to / discuss in the Swift forums
- I find anything functional-programming related to be absolutely fascinating
- I’m currently working on an app, Tap It, made for storing and peer-to-peer sharing of social media accounts. Definitely check out the source code on the [Github Repo]()!

Feel free to contact me through Twitter, email, or my [Linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nikita-mounier-b80539216).
