# Hello, there.

```swift
print("Hello, world!")
```

That was the first line of code I ever wrote. A bit cliché? Definitely. Completely unoriginal? Most likely. And yet, that may have been the most important line of code I will ever write. Because ever since that day, I ever since that moment, I fell in love with coding. Ok, this is definitely becoming too cliché. 

Why? Why did I fall in love? I’ve been asking myself that question for a while now, and I feel like I’ll continue asking it my whole life. Is it the ability ,to use pure logic and reasoning to create something beautifully complex? Is it the power I sense at my fingertips when I know that I can do almost anything just by hitting some letters and symbols on a keyboard? Is it the sense of community and belonging that comes with diving into the world of coding? It may be all of them at once, and there may be an infinity of other reasons too.

I should probably slow down. This is only the beginning of this website after all. Why answer such a vast question straight away? Let me answer a simpler question first. Why this website in the first place? I’ve been coding for almost two years, and I’ve survived up until now. Nonetheless, over these two years however, I’ve come to cherish something I find very special: expression. And no, not an expression as in `Expression was too complex to be solved in reasonable time`, an error one might get in Swift when writing a long-winded chain of functional methods. No, I mean expression as in being able to express my interest in coding to other people. In my school, we are a very rare specimen. Rarely am I ever able to talk about some serious coding concepts with another physical person. In fact, I’ve been able to talk about advanced coding with a grand total of one person. Which, you guessed it, isn’t a large amount. This means that I’ve had all this interest, all this passion for coding bottled up inside me, unable to express it to other people.

So, I guess this website is a sort of functional-reactive sink, where my stream of interest for coding, who’s source is that very first line of code I wrote two years ago, and to which I apply some “literacy” and “writing” operators, gets piped down the drain and condensed into these articles. Jeez. Sorry you had to read that. Maybe I’ll write an article where I explain what all that gibberish meant. No promises, though — it might be a little too meta. 

In any case, I hope you enjoy the website. And don’t forget — think different.
