title: Reducers, or understanding the shape of functions
---

Swift is a peculiar language in that it combines many “paradigms” – styles of programming – to create a sort of melting pot where developers can pick and choose which style they prefer. One such paradigm that I’m very interested in is “functional programming”. [Wikipedia states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a […] paradigm in which function definitions […] map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.

*Applying and composing functions*. Sounds a bit abstract, doesn’t it? What does that actually mean? In this article, I want to show you concrete examples of this paradigm in Swift through *reducers*, and teach you a core skill in functional programming: understanding the shape of functions.  <!--more-->

## Functional methods in Swift

As I said before, Swift has deep roots in functional programming. This can be best seen in its standard library, where it offers higher-order functions notably on Sequences.

A first example of this is the `.map { }` method. Say we want to go from an array of `Car` to an array of `Driver`:

```swift
let cars: [Car] = [Car(model: .tesla(.roadster), topSpeed: 250, seats: 4), Car(...), ...]
// Imperative:
var drivers: [Driver] = []
for car in cars {
    drivers.append(Driver(familySize: car.seats, isAdventurous: car.topSpeed > 150))
}

// Functional:
let drivers = cars.map { Driver(familySize: $0.seats, isAdventurous: $0.topSpeed > 150) }
```

There is an important distinction between the two. In the imperative way, we are going step-by-step telling Swift exactly what mutations we want to happen when and where. Meanwhile, in the functional way, we are simply ***describing*** the transformation we want to happen, by giving the `.map { }` a closure in which we produce a new `Driver` when given a `Car`.

Even better we can make this even more succinct and descriptive by providing `Driver` with a special initializer:

```swift
extension Driver {
    init(car: Car) { /* ... */ }
}

let drivers = cars.map(Driver.init)
```

Now, we’re truly describing what we want to happen: we want to map each `Car` in the array into a `Driver`. As simple as that. No weird mutations, which means no space for error. 

A similar thing can be said for the `.filter { }` method. Instead of mapping over each element of a sequence, we instead include only certain elements from a sequence, based on a condition given some element. It’ll be clearer when I show it to you.

Say we want to create a new `Driver` array, which only contains the adventurous drivers.

```swift
// Imperative:
var adventurousDrivers: [Driver] = []
for driver in drivers {
    if driver.isAdventurous {
        adventurousDrivers.append(driver)
    }
}

// Functional:
let adventurousDrivers = drivers.filter { $0.isAdventurous }
```

Once again, in the imperative method, we’re going line by line, conditionally appending the driver if their `isAdventurous` property is set to true. Meanwhile once again in the functional way we’re just describing the condition given a driver, freeing us from having to perform error-prone mutations ourselves. Even better, thanks to [SE-0249 - Key Path Expressions as Functions](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0249-key-path-literal-function-expressions.md), we can shorten it to this:

```swift
let adventurousDrivers = drivers.filter(\.isAdventurous)
```

Clean, right? I think that you now have a good understanding on how `map` and `filter` are part of the foundational building blocks of functional programming. They are tools which offer us transformations on basic types like arrays and dictionaries. 

Going back to the Wikipedia quote, it seems like we’ve become quite good at *applying* functions. So the logical next step would be *composing* functions, right?

## The Composition Dilemma

Let’s look at the signature for both `map` and `filter` on sequences:

> `func map<T>(_ transform: (Element)  -> T) -> [T]`
>
> `func filter(_ isIncluded: (Element) -> Bool) -> [Element]`

Both of the methods seem to return a new array — `map` returns an array of some generic type `T`, and filter returns an array with elements of the same type `Element`. Since they’re both extensions on sequences, we should be able to just chain these two together.

Say we wanted to go straight from an array of cars to an array of adventurous drivers. Intuitively, we can do this:

```swift
let adventurousDrivers = cars
	.map(Driver.init) // [Car] -> [Driver]
	.filter(\.isAdventurous) // Include only drivers with isAdventurous == true
```

Looks nice and functional, don’t you think? However, there is a hidden problem lurking in this piece of code. The issue is, these two `map` and `filter` methods have no idea about each other’s existence.  Therefore, `map` allocates a whole new array, applies its transformation, and returns the array — and then `filter` allocates another whole new array, filters in the elements which pass the condition, and returns the second array. We’ve allocated two arrays in an operation which really should only require one. 

Let me translate this exact code into imperative code so that you can see what I mean:

```swift
var driversFromCars: [Driver] = [] // array 1
for car in cars {
    driversFromCars.append(Driver(car: car))
}

var adventurousDrivers: [Driver] = [] // array 2
for driver in driversFromCars {
    if driver.isAdventurous {
        adventurousDrivers.append(driver)
    }
}
return adventurousDrivers
```

If you are familiar with the concept of [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity), this operation is *O(n^2^)*, when it should really be *O(n)*.

“So what?”, I hear you say. “Why should I care? Allocating two arrays with a couple of elements is no big deal.” Sure, it doesn’t make a difference with today’s hardware if you have a couple of elements each with a handful of properties.

 But once you start getting into the thousands / tens of thousands of elements, and each element has their own arrays with sequences with hundreds of elements — that’s when you start noticing stutters and performance drops in your software. And last time I checked, nobody likes performance drops.

## Reducers to the rescue

First, a short introduction to reducers. The `reduce` function is the third foundational building block of functional programming, alongside `map` and `filter`. I like to call `reduce` the “Swiss army knife of functions”, because it can do just about anything — including mapping and filtering. Confused? Let me explain.

Instead of showing the `.reduce { }` method in action like I did for `map` and `filter`, I’m going to show you the ***shape*** of a reducer. By shape, I mean the relation between its parameters and return value:

```swift
typealias Reducer<A, B> = (A, B) -> A
```

As you see, a reducer takes two input parameters, of type  `A` and `B`, and then *reduces* the two into a new value of type `A`. At its core, that’s all there is to a reducer. 

So how could that possibly help us in our composition dilemma with `map` and `filter`?

Well, in the case of `map`, we could think of `A` as the new array we want to create, and `B` as an element of the old array which we shall transform. Then, the reducer will iterate on each element of the old array, updating the new array each time as we transform each element. Something like this:

```swift
let drivers: [Driver] = cars
	.reduce([]) { (newArray: [Driver], oldElement: Car) -> [Driver] in // (A, B) -> A
    	var accumulation = newArray
        accumulation.append(Driver(car: oldElement)) // this gets called on each element
        return accumulation
    }
```

This code snippet is definitely a lot to take in. Essentially, for each element in the old array, we’re *reducing* the new array and the current element, by adding the transformed element to the accumulation.

This means we can define `map` by only using a reducer:

```swift
extension Sequence {
    func reducerMap<B>(_ transform: @escaping (Element) -> B) -> [B] {
        return self.reduce([]) { accumulation, element in
            return accumulation + [transform(element)]
        }
    }
}

let drivers = cars.map(Driver.init)
let reducerDrivers = cars.reducerMap(Driver.init)

print(drivers == reducerDrivers) // true
```

Now that we’ve settled that `reduce` can be used as a generalization over `map`, let’s see how the same can be said for `filter`.

Let’s remind ourselves how we defined a reducer:

```swift
typealias Reducer<A, B> = (A, B) -> A
```

Much like with `map`, we can think of `A` as the new array we want to create. However, instead of `B` being the element of the old array which will be transformed, `B` is the element of the old array which will conditionally be added to `A`.

```swift
let adventurousDrivers: [Driver] = driver
	.reduce([]) { newArray, oldElement -> [Driver] in // (A, B) -> A
        if oldElement.isAdventurous {
            return newArray + [oldElement]
        } else {
            return newArray
        }
    }
```

We’re *reducing* the new array and the current element not by adding the transformed element, but instead by only adding the element if it meets our condition. This means that we can also define `filter` by only using a reducer:

```swift
extension Sequence {
    func reducerFilter(_ isIncluded: @escaping (Element) -> Bool) -> [Element] {
        return self.reduce([]) { accumulation, element in
            if isIncluded(element) {
                return accumulation + [element]
            } else {
                return newArray
            }
        }
    }
}

let adventurousDrivers = drivers.filter(\.isAdventurous)
let reducerAdventurousDrivers = drivers.reducerFilter(\.isAdventurous)

print(adventurousDrivers == reducerAdventurousDrivers) // true
```

Now we’ve demonstrated that `reduce` can also be used as a generalization over `filter`. 

Before we go any further, there’s a pattern I’ve noticed in both the `reducer...` functions:

```swift
return accumulation + [element]
```

This is actually quite an essential part to our reducers, since they define *how* we want to reduce the two parameters. Let’s extract this into its own function for reusability’s sake.

```swift
func append<A, B>(_ element: A, to accumulation: B) -> B where B.Element == A {
    return accumulation + [element]
}
```

Interestingly, this function itself is a reducer — you can clearly see the shape of `(A, B) -> A`.

Back to the composition dilemma. How could we restore performance without falling back into the messy mutation-filled world of imperative programming? We could try combining the two `map` and `filter` reducers we created up above:

```swift
let adventurousDrivers = cars
	.reduce([]) { accumulation, element in
         let driver = Drive(car: element) // from map
         if driver.isAdventurous { // from filter
             return append(driver, to: accumulation)
         } else {
             return accumulation
         }
     }
```

Not bad! Now, thanks to the reducer, we’re back to not creating an intermediate array between the mapping and filtering. However, we have in a sense lost some composition — we’re back to doing imperative control flow, and every time we want to add a map or filter to it we’ll have to carefully place it to make sure we’re not making any logic errors. Can’t there be some way to generalize all our logic here into simple, composable functions?
